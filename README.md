# Posh Tasklog

Powershell module to let me do very simple work logging.

Written in F# - because (-:

## Commands

* Start something - it needs a title
* Stop whatever it is I last started
* Note something, assumed to be part of whatever it is I'm working

## Plan

1. Work through an example of an F# cmdlet
1. Document Start funcitonality
1. Can I test with Pester ??
   1. Yes if I can set up a test drive and use it as the target for my commands
   1. This also means that I need to understand `$psdefaultparametervalues`
1. Implement test functionality
